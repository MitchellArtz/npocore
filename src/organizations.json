As high schoolers ourselves, we could easily think of ways we can contribute and help make difficult concepts simpler. With the joint efforts of multiple schools and after-school programs, we formulated the Infinity project.\n\nSecond, we wanted people to feel empowered to make a difference and make changes in their community. There is a lot of ideas that high schoolers have that could potentially change the world someday and we found Irvine LIGHTS as the perfect opportunity to give a platform for those students and ideas. That's how the Beyond project came about.\n\nLastly, we wanted to spark collaboration. It wasn't enough to make this a club at just one school. This needed to be a way for people passionate about a topic to express themselves. Through diligent advertising and different marketing strategies, we were able to get the attention of hundreds of students in our community. That's why we pushed out: Irvine LIGHTS chapters.
